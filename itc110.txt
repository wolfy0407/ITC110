1.    What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Answer: True, False (their capitalized because their named after the mathematician George Boole)
    
2. What are the three Boolean operators?
Comparison, Boolean operators and Boolean values
    
3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to). 
The values of the integer, floating point, and string data
    
4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
(5 > 4)less than and (3 == 5)False three is not equal to 5
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
?    (True and True) and (True == False)
?    (not False) or (not True)
    
5. What are the six comparison operators?
==,  =,  =!, <,  >,  <=, >=
    
6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
?    The == operator (equal to) asks whether two values are the same as each other
?    The =  operator assignment puts the value on the right into the variable on the left
    
7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
?    A condition’s are expressions, conditions a specific name when speaking of flow control statements deciding their next step whether it’s true or false.
    
8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0 
if spam == 10: 
?    ends a string
   print('eggs') name command
   if spam > 5:
?    Block
       print('bacon')   
else: 
?    stops a commands repeating could be used in the same category as three if statements as well as with elif
       print('ham')
   print('spam')
print('spam')
    9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! If anything else is stored in spam.

Spam = ‘1’
Print (‘hello’)
Spam = ‘2’
Print (‘Howdy’)
Greetings

    
10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
?    Ctrl, Alt, C
    
11. What is the difference between break and continue?
Break stops the string or command and continue loop back around starting from the top of the string.
    
12. What is the difference between range (10), range (0, 10), and range (0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
   (10) Is absolute value and (0-10) a range between the two numbers and (0, 10, 1) a false implication and creates a syntax error.
    
13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
?    Print (‘my name is’) 
For I in range (1,10):
?    Print = ‘ ‘
While name != ‘ your name’:
(‘Print please type your name.’)
Name = input ()


    
14. If you had a function named bacon () inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
Extra credit: Look up the round() and abs() functions on the Internet, and find out what they do. Experiment with them in the interactive shell.
?    Round—shaped like or approximately like a circle or a cylinder, a circular piece of a particular substance

?    Abs function returns the absolute value of a number the absolute values the number without its sign.
